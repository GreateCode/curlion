# curlpp

## Introduction

curlpp is a C++ wrapper for libcurl multi socket interface. It hides the complexity of multi socket, provides an easy-to-use interface.

## Requirement

A C++11 compatible compiler is required.

Since multi socket's feature, an event-driven mechanism is also required, such as boost.asio, libevent and so on.

## Usage

The usage of curlpp is simple. But the event-driven mechanism is a problem, since it is implement-dependent, impossible to wrap into curlpp. So it is user's responsibilty to implement the mechanism. 

curlpp provides some interfaces simplify the implementation of event-driven mechanism. Refer to example for more detail.

## Example

Currently, there is an example shows how to use curlpp cooperating with boost.asio. More examples will be add in the future.

## Documentation

curlpp contains brief documentation in source files. A HTML version documentation can be generated by doxygen using doc/doxygen script file.

More detail documentation can be found at [libcurl documentation page](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/).
